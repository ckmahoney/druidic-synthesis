**visibility**, **energy**, **presence**, and **f**

This is the context available to design a synthesizer preset. 

That is, 

You get VEP to choose how-to-generate a hats preset. Is it enough? Of course! **High energy** hats will have a different range of output compared to **low energy** hats, right? And a **legato presence** is going to sound more like an "open hat" compared to a **staccato** presence of a closed hi hat.



The VEP parameters are described individually with their specific behaviors.

How can we used them to choose which elements go into a **druidic preset**?
