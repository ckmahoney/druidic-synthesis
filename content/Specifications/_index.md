**Your spellbook for dynamic additive synthesis**

Druidic Synthesis is an additive model for creating a collection of related dynamic synthesizers.

It is inspired by conventional *physical modelling*. However, Druidic Synthesis has no specific goal of reproducing conventnional acoustic sounds. Druidic Synthesis lends itself to *fantastic modelling.*

Every druidic synthesizer is dynamic in that each noteevent performed will be distinct, yet feel related to the rest of its notes. This model defines how to generalize organic phrasing.
