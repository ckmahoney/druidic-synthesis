Instantaneous subtlety

Microtransients are sounds that demark audio events. The start of any sound contains microtransients. The chatter of your teeth in the middle of a word adds tiny inflections of clicks that help us distinguish one syllable from the next.

The smallest duration we can perceive is about 0.005 seconds in length. This correlates to a 200 Hertz frequency. This indicates we can perceive exactly 1 complete cycle for any frequency under 200 Hertz.
