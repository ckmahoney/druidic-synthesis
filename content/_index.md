Druidic Synthesis is an additive model for creating dynamic synthesizers.

It is inspired by conventional *physical modelling*. However, Druidic Synthesis has no specific goal of reproducing conventnional acoustic sounds. Druidic Synthesis lends itself to *fantastic modelling.*

This site is intended to describe a model applied in some programming language or modular synthesizer.  You can find a rust implementation of this model at [raudio](https://github.com/ckmahoney/raudio).
