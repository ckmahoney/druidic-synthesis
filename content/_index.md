A fantastical model for audio synthesis

These documents are an early proposal for generically describing expressive sound as a function of human readable input.

Druidic Synthesis is an extension of Additive Synthesis, and a neighbor to Physical Modelling. Unlike physical modelling, druidic synthesis does not necessarily aim to reproduce sounds of nature. Instead, it fabricates new natures and evolves them over the course of their respective lifetimes.

You can find a rust implementation of this model at [raudio](https://github.com/ckmahoney/raudio).

This site is intended to describe a model applied in some programming language or modular synthesizer.
