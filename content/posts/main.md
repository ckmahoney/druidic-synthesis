**Your cookbook for dynamic additive synthesis**

Druidic Synthesis is an additive model for creating a collection of related dynamic synthesizers.

Each synth is dynamic in that every noteevent performed by a druidic synth will be distinct, yet feel related to the rest of its notes.

The synths in the collection are related in that they may interact with one another in terms of amplitude or frequency cross-reading.
